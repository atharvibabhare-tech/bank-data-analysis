# Bank Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of bank
customer data to understand customer behavior and analyze the
effectiveness of marketing campaigns. The goal is to identify
key factors that influence customer subscription decisions.

## Objectives
- Analyze bank customer data to discover patterns and trends
- Understand factors affecting customer subscription (`y`)
- Evaluate campaign effectiveness using visualizations
- Gain insights to support data-driven decision making

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information related to bank customers and
marketing campaigns, including:
- Customer demographics (job, education, marital status)
- Campaign-related attributes (contact type, duration, campaign count)
- Previous campaign outcomes
- Subscription status (target variable)
